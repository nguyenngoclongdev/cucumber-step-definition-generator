## Examples

````feature
Feature: Calculator
    As a user
    I want to use a calculator to add numbers
    So that I don't need to add myself

    Scenario: Add two numbers -2 & 3
        Given I have a calculator
        When I add "-2" and "3"
        Then the result should be "1"

    Scenario: Add two numbers 10 & 15
        Given I have a calculator
        When I add "10" and "15"
        Then the result should be "25"
````

````typescript
import { Given, When, Then } from '@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor';

Given(`I have a calculator`, () => {
    // The use of 'Given' keyword is to put the system in a familiar state before the user starts interacting with the system.
});

When(`I add {string} and {string}`, (arg1: string, arg2: string) => {
    // When the step is to define action performed by the user.
});

Then(`the result should be {string}`, (arg1: string) => {
    // The use of 'Then' keyword is to see the outcome after the action in when step.
});
